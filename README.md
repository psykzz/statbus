# Python Statbus for /TG/ Servers
This is an open source statbus for the [/tg/station](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/) database code Space Station 13 server. It was created to provide a python alternative for those that dislike other languages.

# Requirements
The following packages are required:
* flask
* peewee

You can install the requirements from the requirements.txt file.

# Setting up
Make sure you have a read-only database account and that you have whitelisted just the server you will be hosting this on for security reasons. Head into the config folder and either create a new file called production.ini (recommended for further security reasons) or open the config.py file and edit the appropriate values.
